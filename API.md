Version `1`

Notes:

- If sending a JSON body, the correct HTTP header must be sent: `Content-Type: application/json`.  
- In future, this documentation will be auto-generated ðŸ˜…
- Parameters should follow the [Docopt](http://docopt.org/) format
- Unless otherwise noted, all references to 'speed' refer to the aircraft airspeed (usually in CAS)
- In general, any endpoint may return a `400 Bad Request` if the required parameters were not provided in the correct format

## Define Waypoint (DEFWPT)

Defines a custom waypoint:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/defwpt
{
    "wpname": "TEST",
    "lat": 1.23,
    "lon": 4.56,
    ["type": "<type>"]
}
```

Notes:

- Currently BlueSky does not detect duplicate waypoints
- `<type>` is an (optional) custom string which can be used to tag waypoints

Returns:

- `201 Created` - Waypoint was defined
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Could not define the waypoint (error will be provided)

## Change Simulation Rate Multiplier (DTMULT)

Changes the simulation rate multiplier:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/dtmult
{
    "multiplier": 1.5
}
```

Returns:

- `200 Ok` - Rate multiplier was changed
- `400 Bad Request` - Rate multiplier was invalid
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Could not change the rate multiplier (error will be provided).

## Pause Simulation (HOLD)

Pauses the simulation:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/hold
```

Returns:  

- `200 Ok` - Simulation was paused
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Simulation could not be paused

## Load Scenario (IC)

Resets the simulation and loads the scenario specified in the given filename. The `filename` parameter is required:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/ic
{
  "filename": "scenario/<scenario>.scn",
  ["multiplier": 1.0]   // Optional: simulation rate multiplier
}
```  

Where the file path is relative to the BlueSky root directory. In future there will hopefully be some central store of scenario files which can be used in addition to the ones bundled with BlueSky.

Note that the `.scn` extension will always be added if not specified, so the scenarios `test` and `test.scn` are equivalent.

Returns:

- `200 Ok` - Scenario was loaded
- `400 Bad Request` - File extension or multiplier were invalid
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Could not load the scenario
	- This could be due to the file not existing, or case-sensitivity of the given filename (some are named `*.scn`, while others are `*.SCN`)

## Resume Simulation (OP)

Resumes the simulation:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/op
```

Returns:  

- `200 Ok` - Simulation was resumed
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Simulation could not be resumed

## Create Scenario

Creates a scenario with the provided content:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/scenario
{
    "scn_name": "test",
    "content": [
        "00:00:00>CRE SWR39W A320 EHAM RWY18L * 0 0",
        "00:00:01>SPD SWR39W 300",
        "00:00:01>ALT SWR39W FL300"
    ],
    ["start_new": true],    // Optional: start the simulation after upload
    ["start_dtmult": 5.0]   // Optional: simulation rate multiplier
}
```

Notes:

- The `.scn` extension will always be added if not specified, so the scenarios `test` and `test.scn` are equivalent.
- Any existing scenario with the same name will be overwritten
- Each line in `content` must contain a timestamp and a valid BlueSky command. The timestamp must be in the format `hh:mm:ss`
- A small delay should be included between creating an aircraft and issuing commands to it

Returns:  

- `200 Ok` - Simulation was created and started
- `201 Created` - Simulation was created
- `400 Bad Request` - Error with simulation content
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Simulation could not be uploaded, or could not be started after upload

## Reset Simulation

Resets the simulation and clears all aircraft data:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/reset
```

Returns:  

- `200 Ok` - Simulation was reset
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Simulation could not be reset

## Simulation Time

Get the current simulated time:

```javascript
GET /api/v1/time
```

Returns:  

- `200 Ok` - Time retrieved. Data will of the form:

```javascript
{
    "sim_utc": "2019-04-17 00:12:08.300000"
}
```

- `500 Internal Server Error` - Time could not be retrieved - response will contain error info

## Simulation Step (STEP)

Step the simulation forward:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/step
```

Notes:

- The simulation must be in `agent` mode otherwise an error will be returned
- The timestep is based on `DTMULT`, so a setting of 5.0x will step forward 5 seconds

Returns:

- `200 Ok` - Simulation was stepped
- `400 Bad Request` - If the request was not made while in `agent` mode 
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Could not step - response will contain error info

---

## Add Waypoint (ADDWPT)
