Version `1`

Notes:

- If sending a JSON body, the correct HTTP header must be sent: `Content-Type: application/json`.  
- In future, this documentation will be auto-generated ðŸ˜…
- Parameters should follow the [Docopt](http://docopt.org/) format
- Unless otherwise noted, all references to 'speed' refer to the aircraft airspeed (usually in CAS)
- In general, any endpoint may return a `400 Bad Request` if the required parameters were not provided in the correct format

## Scenario Load (IC)

Resets the simulation and loads the scenario specified in the given filename. The `filename` parameter is required:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/ic
{
  "filename": "scenario/<scenario>.scn",
  ["multiplier": 1.0]   // Optional: speed multiplier
}
```  
 
Where the file path is relative to the BlueSky root directory. The filename must end with `.scn`. In future there will hopefully be some central store of scenario files which can be used in addition to the ones bundled with BlueSky.

Returns:

- `200 Ok` - Scenario was loaded
- `400 Bad Request` - Either the filename or multiplier were invalid
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Could not load the scenario
	- This could be due to the file not existing, or case-sensitivity of the given filename (some are named `*.scn`, while others are `*.SCN`)
  
## Simulation Reset

Resets the simulation and clears all aircraft data:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/reset
```

Returns:  

- `200 Ok` - Simulation was reset
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Simulation could not be reset

## Simulation Time (TIME)

Get or set the current simulated time:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/time
{
    ["time": <time>]
}
```

The `<time>` argument (if specified) must be one of the following:

- `RUN` - Default if not specified. Returns the current simulated time
- `REAL` - Return the current UTC time (not sure this is particularly useful...)
- `HH:MM:SS.mmm` - Set the simulated time to the given time-string

Returns:  

- `200 Ok` - Simulation time was set
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Time could not be set, or input time was invalid

## Simulation Pause (HOLD)

Pauses the simulation:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/hold
```

Returns:  

- `200 Ok` - Simulation was paused
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Simulation could not be paused

## Simulation Resume (OP)

Resumes the simulation:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/op
```

Returns:  

- `200 Ok` - Simulation was resumed
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Simulation could not be resumed

## Define Waypoint (DEFWPT)

Defines a custom waypoint:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/defwpt
{
    "wpname": "TEST",
    "lat": 1.23,
    "lon": 4.56,
    ["type": "<type>"]
}
```

Notes:

- Currently BlueSky does not detect duplicate waypoints
- `<type>` is an (optional) custom string which can be used to tag waypoints

Returns:

- `200 Ok` - Waypoint was defined
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Could not change the speed (error will be provided).


## Simulation Speed Change (DTMULT)

Changes the simulation speed:

```javascript
POST /api/v1/dtmult
{
    "multiplier": 1.5
}
```

Returns:

- `200 Ok` - Speed was changed
- `400 Bad Request` - Multiplier was invalid
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Could not change the speed (error will be provided).

---

## Create Aircraft (CRE)

Creates an aircraft. The following data must be provided:  

```javascript
POST /api/v1/cre
{
  "acid": "TST1000",		// Aircraft ID (alphanumeric, at least 3 characters)
  "type": "B744",		// Aircraft type
  "lat": "0",			// Initial latitude (deg)
  "lon": "0",			// Initial longitude (deg)
  "hdg": "0",			// Initial heading (deg)
  "alt": "FL250",		// Initial altitude (feet or FL)
  "spd": "250"			// Initial calibrated air speed (CAS) (kts or Mach)
}  
```

Returns:

- `201 Created` - Aircraft was created
- `400 Bad Request` - Aircraft already exists
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Other error, response will contain data e.g.:
 
```javascript
"Error: simulation returned: Syntax error processing argument 5:"
"Could not parse \"-FL050\" as altitude"
"CRE acid,type,lat,lon,hdg,alt,spd"
```

## Direct to Waypoint (DIRECT)
 
Instructs an aircraft to go directly to the specified waypoint. The waypoint must exist on the aircraft's route.  
 
```javascript
POST /api/v1/direct
{
    "acid": "TST1000",      // Aircraft ID (alphanumeric, at least 3 characters)
    "waypoint": "TESTWPT"   // The name of the waypoint to go to 
}  
```
   
Returns:
 
- `200 Ok` - Command was excepted
- `400 Bad Request` - Aircraft ID was invalid
- `404 Not Found` - The specified aircraft did not exist in the simulation
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Other error, response will contain data. Note there is currently no way to distinguish between the waypoint not existing, and the waypoint extsting but not being on the aircraft's route. 

## Position (POS)

Request information on specific aircraft, or all:

```javascript
GET /api/v1/pos?acid=[<acid>[,<acid> ...]|"all"]
```
  
Returns:
